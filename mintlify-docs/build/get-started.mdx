### **Introduction**

Welcome to the Nation app agent creation guide\! This step-by-step tutorial will show you how to create and update an agent for your needs on the Nation platform. Follow these instructions carefully to set up and maintain your agent effectively.

### **Step 1: Ensure You Have Access**

Before you start, make sure you meet the necessary requirements to create an agent.

1. **Login Requirements:**
   - **Whitelisted User:** You need to be logged into the Nation app with a wallet account that has been whitelisted for agent creation. This whitelist process is handled by the **Crestal team**.
   - **NFT Holding:** The whitelisted account must be holding a Nation Pass NFT to create an agent. Ensure you this NFT is in the wallet you’re using to login.
2. **Verifying Access:**
   - If you’re unsure whether your account has been whitelisted, contact the Crestal team.

### **Step 2: Decide on the Type of Agent**

Next, decide what kind of agent you want to create.

1. **Select the Role and Purpose:**
   - You can create various types of agents based on the functionality you need. For example:
     - **Relationship Advisor**: Provides advice on personal relationships.
     - **Cooking Assistant**: Offers guidance and tips for users looking for interesting recipes.
     - **Custom Agents**: You might also have the flexibility to create agents for business, coaching, trading or other personalized uses.
2. **Planning Your Agent’s Role:**
   - Think about the kind of interactions you want the agent to have. Should it be casual or professional? Does it need to provide detailed responses or simply offer quick tips?
   - This will help you tailor your agent’s behavior and responses later.

### **Step 3: Upload an Image for the Agent**

1. **Click to Upload:**
   - First, you will need to **upload an image** to represent your agent. Click on the "Click to upload" button, or drag and drop your image file into the upload area.
   - **Image Requirements**:
     - The image should be under **1MB** in size.
     - It can be in **JPEG** or **PNG** format.
     - Square images are preferred

### **Step 4: Enter Agent Name**

1. **Agent Name**:
   - Type in the **name** you want to assign to your agent. This will be how users identify the agent.
   - Choose a name that represents the agent’s purpose or personality, e.g., "Dating Advisor" or "Tim the Trader."

### **Step 4: Enter Token Ticker**

1. **Token Ticker**:
   - Enter a **token ticker** for your agent. This is the unique identifier for the token associated with your agent.
   - This Ticker name cannot be updated

### **Step 5: Purpose**

1. **Describe the Purpose of the Agent**:
   - In the **Purpose** field, describe the primary role or function of the agent.
   - Example:
     - “This agent is a **relationship advisor** who provides users with advice on relationships, dating, and personal growth.”
     - Be clear about what users can expect from the agent’s services.
     - This purpose will be also used by the agent as an instruction.

### **Step 6: Personality**

1. **Describe the Agent's Personality**:
   - The personality section helps define how the agent will interact with users.
   - Example:
     - "The agent is friendly, warm, and empathetic. It engages users in casual, conversational tones and offers supportive advice."
     - Keep in mind that the agent’s personality can evolve over time, so feel free to start with a basic description and adjust as you go along.

### **Step 7: Principles**

1. **Describe Principles for the Agent**:
   - In the **Principles** section, list the guiding principles that define how the agent will behave and what it should and should not do.
   - Example:
     - “The agent will always be respectful, avoid giving harmful advice, and prioritize user safety. It will not engage in offensive or inappropriate conversations.”
   - These principles will help shape the agent’s interactions and ensure it follows your guidelines.

### **Step 8: Public Chat and Private Instructions**

1. **Public Chat**:
   - Toggle the **Public Chat** option to **on** or **off** based on whether you want the agent to be available for public interactions.
   - If turned **off**,  you will be the only user able to chat to this agent on the Nation app.
2. **Private Instructions**:
   - Set the **Private Instructions** to **on** or **off** to provide the agent with specific instructions only visible to it (e.g., internal logic for its behavior that is not shared with the public).
   - This feature allows you to customize responses or actions without disclosing them to users.

### **Step 9: Finalizing the Agent**

1. **Save the Agent**:
   - After filling out all the necessary fields, make sure to save your agent’s settings.
   - An on chain transaction is triggered to save the agent onchain.
   - Your agent is now created and ready to interact based on the configuration you set up.

### **Step 10: Testing and Feedback**

Once your agent is set up or updated, it's essential to test it.

1. **Test Your Agent’s Interactions:**
   - Try interacting with the agent to ensure it’s performing as expected. Check the dialogue flow, responsiveness, and overall user experience.
2. **Collect Feedback:**
   - Ask users for feedback to improve the agent’s performance. This will help you identify any areas that may need tweaking.

### **Conclusion**

Now you have a fully created agent with its own **wallet** and configuration\! This agent can interact with users, handle transactions, and evolve based on feedback.
