title: 'IntentKit Setup: Docker and Local Development'
description: This guide will help you set up IntentKit quickly, whether you prefer using Docker for a streamlined installation or setting up a local development environment for customization and coding.

## Docker (Recommended)

Docker is the fastest and easiest way to set up IntentKit with minimal configuration. It creates a containerized environment that isolates dependencies and configurations.

1. **Create a new directory:**
   ```bash
   mkdir intentkit && cd intentkit
   ```

2. **Download the required files:**
   ```bash
   # Download docker-compose.yml
   curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crestalnetwork/intentkit/main/docker-compose.yml

   # Download example environment file
   curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crestalnetwork/intentkit/main/example.env
   ```

3. **Set up your environment:**
   ```bash
   # Rename example.env to .env
   mv example.env .env

   # Edit the .env file to add your configuration
   nano .env
   ```
   > Ensure you add your `OPENAI_API_KEY` in the `.env` file. This is required for the AI capabilities of IntentKit. Full guide on how to generate an OpenAI API key can be found [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart#create-and-export-an-api-key).

4. **Start the services:**
   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```

   This will launch all necessary services, including the API server and autonomous agent scheduler.

5. After installation, you'll want to create your first agent. Head over to our [Agent Creation and Configuration](./agent-guide) guide to learn how to create and configure agents.

## Local Development

For developers who want to customize or extend IntentKit, setting up a local development environment provides more control and flexibility.

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/crestalnetwork/intentkit.git
   cd intentkit
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   Ensure you have Python 3.10-3.12 installed (3.12 is recommended). If you donâ€™t have `poetry` installed, do so first:
   ```bash
   pip install poetry
   ```

   Then, install the project dependencies:
   ```bash
   poetry install --with dev
   poetry shell
   ```

3. **Set up your environment:**
   ```bash
   cp example.env .env
   nano .env
   ```

   Configure the `.env` file with your settings, including the required `OPENAI_API_KEY`. Full guide on how to generate an OpenAI API key can be found [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart#create-and-export-an-api-key).


4. **Run the application:**
   - **Start the API server:**
     ```bash
     uvicorn app.entrypoints.api:app --reload
     ```
   - **Start the autonomous agent scheduler:**
     ```bash
     python -m app.entrypoints.autonomous
     ```

   Both services are now running locally and ready for use.

5. **Creating Your First Agent**

After installation, you'll want to create your first agent. Head over to our [Agent Creation and Configuration](./agent-guide) guide to learn how to create and configure agents.
